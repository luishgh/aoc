* Disclaimer!

I do not intend to support any external use for this program. I've built it only for my personal use, so that's the only one that I plan on supporting. Hope you understand :).

* Expected schema

- program file :: something like =2022/day1.cpp=
- example file :: something like =2022/day1.ex=
- example output file :: something like =2022/day1.ex.out=
- input file :: something like =2022/day1.in=

You can disable testing against the example using the ~--no-example~ flag.
